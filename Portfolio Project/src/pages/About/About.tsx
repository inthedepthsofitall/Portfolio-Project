      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> I started my journey into software development when I decided I wanted to create a business website for my real estate side hustle. I realized that 
          I wanted to present to people that I am multi-faceted individual with knowledge in different worlds including tech. I was able to link the mls/s, give investors some strategies when
          looking to invest, I also try to clue the buyers and sellers on things to consider prior to moving forward with a life changing investment. I also used SQl to store new clients data.
          A few clients complimented me on the website and thought it was professional and unique as they did not see many agents taking this approach.
          I started to look into what else I could do with software and that is when I saw content on trading bots which sparked my interest as I was already
          investing/trading in the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>Prior to learning software development, I was a full time Mixed Martial Artist and also day trading.  All my life I have had to work uphill as I did not have the ideal 
        body type for athletics. I played baseball throughout high-school and JUCO(community-college) and the first thing scouts would tell me is that my build is not ideal from 
        a durability perspective as I was under 6 feet tall and under 175 pounds. It did not stop me from proving them wrong and getting a chance to play a higher level of baseball 
        competition. One of my baseball roommates introduced me to Mixed Martial Arts and from there I was hooked. I sent in my retirement notice to GM and started to pursue a career 
        in Mixed Martial Arts. Despite not having the ideal body type I was able to have a successful career which I attribute to my hard work and overall embracement of the journey.
        I see a lot of the similarities between Mixed Martial Arts and Software Development where everyday there are certain obstacles to overcome but once you are able to get in a 
        groove, it becomes more smooth over time. The feeling of accomplishing the goal in both worlds is similar and filled with adrenaline/gratification.
