      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I started my journey into software development when I decided I wanted to create a business website for my real estate side hustle. I realized that I wanted to present 
        to people that what I can provide as being their agent. I was able to link the mls/s, give investors some strategies when
        looking to invest, I also try to clue the buyers and sellers on things to consider prior to moving forward with a life changing investment.
        A few clients complimented me on the website and thought it was professional and unique as they did not see many agents taking this approach.
        I started to look into what else I could do with software and that is when I saw content on trading bots which sparked my interest as I was already
        investing/trading in the stock market.
